## 0x02-minimum_operations
**Problem**:

In a text file, there is a single character ``H``. Your text editor can execute
only two operations in this file: ``Copy All`` and ``Paste``. Given a number ``n``,
write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result
in exactly ``n H`` characters in the file.

  * Prototype: ``def minOperations(n)``
  * Returns an integer
  * If ``n`` is impossible to achieve, return ``0``
